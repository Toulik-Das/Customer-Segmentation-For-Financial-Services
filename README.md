# Customer-Segmentation-For-Financial-Services

## Overview 
In this project, I analyzed the demographic data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany. The unsupervised learning technique was used to reduce dimensionality and identify the important demographic features that may contribute to online purchase. The supervised learning, or Gradient Boosting Classifier, was used next to fit the training data. Parameters were tuned according to accuracy score. The tuned model was then used to predict the test data. Final prediction was submitted to Kaggle competition.

## Problem statement
The problem here is that Arvato company needs to know the audiences that are more likely to become a customer to work towards achieving itâ€™s goals in marketing. Thus, on this project, I am aiming to predict the audiences who are most likely to become a customer. I will approach this problem by first pre-processing the datasets. second, I will use unsupervised learning techniques to create clusters of customer and general population, and then identify the difference. Finally, I will predict whether or not a person will become a customer of Arvato or not.



## Results
