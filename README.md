# Customer-Segmentation-For-Financial-Services

## Overview 
In this project, I analyzed the demographic data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany. The unsupervised learning technique was used to reduce dimensionality and identify the important demographic features that may contribute to online purchase. The supervised learning, or Gradient Boosting Classifier, was used next to fit the training data. Parameters were tuned according to accuracy score. The tuned model was then used to predict the test data. Final prediction was submitted to Kaggle competition.
